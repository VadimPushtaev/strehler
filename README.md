========

Strehler is a light-weight, nerdy, smart CMS in perl based on __Perl Dancer2 framework__.

Yo can use it to easily create the backend of the site you're working on or to manage the data in your database.

Look at the [project wiki](https://github.com/cym0n/strehler/wiki) for more informations.
